# Leadership Anti-patterns: Not keeping organized
This post is part of a larger series on Leadership Anti-patterns. Being a leader for your team likely means doing more work than you actually have time to complete. Unfortunately, this means that you as a leader may not have enough time to keep all of your tasks, documents, and information well-organized and easily accessible.

## What does keeping organized mean?
In a leadership capacity, keeping organized means having easy and quick access to any of the information you and your team need to carry out your regular duties and responsibilities.

For the supervisor of a technical support team in a call center, for example, this may be having ready knowledge about the performance of your team members, the status of daily operations, longer term trends in support contacts, and upcoming sales, offers, maintenance or other external events that will impact your team's workload.

A leader of a product development team would need to know the overall status of the product's roadmap, the skills and experience of the team members making the product, what work is coming up next for the team, the priorities of stakeholders, and the resources the team needs to continue working.

Generally, keeping organized means being able to answer the questions your supervisor, stakeholder, or team members ask you about the work you and your team are doing.

## Why do leaders not keep organized?
Keeping organized sounds like it should be a simple thing, right? The proliferation of organization tools, to-do list managers, team board software, and other such software suggests this is more of a challenge than we like to admit. No one says keeping organized is not a good thing or an important thing, but you generally as a leader are not judged directly on your organization skills. You are judged on the performance of your team in achieving your team's objectives. Many leaders simply do not have the time to keep well-organized if organization is not part of their normal operations. The task may be one that is quick to do and so it gets put off until later. Even if you are lucky enough to have time, how do you keep yourself organized?

### No time to keep organized
Keeping your documents well organized or your desk tidy and neat is not doing whatever your team does to generate value for your company, and generating value is really what you need to do, right? You are being paid to do a certain job, and for most workers your job does not specifically include keeping the information or resources your team needs or generates well-organized, especially if you can always provide that information quickly enough. That stack of papers spread on your desk can wait to be organized if you have customers who need help or deadlines that are coming up soon.

### The easy task trap
You may look at that stack of papers spread across your desk or your crowded email inbox and think to yourself it will only take you five or ten minutes to clear up the mess so why not do it later. How many times in your day do you look at something that needs to get done that will only take a few minutes, but you still put it off until later? The task is so quick to do so it is not as important to do now as a task that will take more time, even though you could easily do the short task and get to the longer task without any problems. That may not seem like a big deal, but when do you actually get back to the quick task?

### Not knowing how to keep organized
What if you do have time to take 30 minutes or an hour each day or each week to keep yourself organized? If you are so lucky, where do you even get started? How do you keep organized over the long term? Some organizations may have tools or systems in place to help you keep organized, but do you know how to use those well? Even when you use the tool well, you may find that no one else on your team or organization does. What good is your well-organized information and resources if they are inaccessible?

## When not keeping organized becomes an anti-pattern
You can probably do your job fairly well and be successful without good organization. Having your work and workspace be perfectly organized is by no means a requirement or guarantee for professional success. However, there are several ways in which a lack of organization can actively hold you and your team back and eventually consume more of your time than you would spend on just keeping organized.

### Lack of critical information
Your job or your team's job probably requires some information to complete, like the day's expected business, any unusual occurrences that would impact the team's operation or workload, changes that the team must implement or respond to, or specific goals the team needs to focus on for the day. Any kind of delay in producing or providing this information to your team can directly and negatively impact your team's ability to meet their requirements. Depending on what your team does your team may not be able to start working until they have this information, or they may have to do their best to improvise until they know what they need to know. This kind of uncertainty can be very distressing for your team members and can contribute to a poor working environment.

### Encouraging disorganization in your team
Your team looks to you to set the tone and standards for your team. If you cannot be expected to keep your workspace tidy and yourself organized, how can you expect that of your team members? Your team being disorganized will keep your team members from servicing your team's customers' needs and from fulfilling your team's responsibilities. They will likely take longer to complete tasks than they otherwise would, and the quality of work may degrade because team members cannot operate at good levels of performance. A disorganized team environment can also contribute to team members leaving your team or your company.

### Your job becomes harder
If you have to spend more than a minute or two at the most to retrieve a piece of information or access a needed resource, especially electronically, you are probably working harder than you need to because of inadequate organization. Poor organization can quickly accrue, like debt, and hinder your ability to do your job. Those tasks that would only take a few minutes to do and get ignored easily can pile up to become an hour or several hours of work paying down your accrued organizational debt. Like debt, you can think of the extra time it takes you do access information or do your job as the interest you are having to pay because you have not kept organized enough.

### Poor responsiveness to external teams
As a leader, you are likely responsible for communicating with other teams or groups on behalf of your team. In this capacity, you are the primary information conduit for your team. If you and your team are disorganized, you may not be able to respond to these other groups in a timely fashion. This can mean not having answers to the questions you are asked during meetings, delays in completing the work that another team has requested, or lower overall quality of work produced by your team.

## How do you keep organized?
Keeping yourself organized depends on you and your responsibilities. The leader of a restaurant team has very different responsibilities from the leader of a software development team, but both leaders still need to make sure their team members have the resources and information they need to do their jobs effectively. There are some general strategies for helping to keep organized regardless of the exact tools or methods you use, like taking detailed notes, keeping a calendar, and setting reminders.

### Taking notes
As a leader, you will be exposed every day to more information than you could possibly remember. If you can write this information down for later review you do not have to worry about remembering it. You can easily answer almost any question that is asked of you as long as you have taken notes and you remember where to look up the information. Even if someone else is taking notes or making a record, like in a meeting, for example, try to take down your own observations, especially if you have different priorities than other people in the meeting.

### Keeping a calendar
Maintaing your appointments and not being late is essential for effectively meeting other people's needs. Using a calendar is a simple and effective way to make sure you keep up with your obligations to others, especially if you can use a calendar that will automatically notify you ahead of your next meeting or provide an easy way to view the day's meetings.

## The pattern of keeping organized
The exact way you keep yourself and your work organized is not really the most important concern. The most important thing is how much keeping organized improves your work and your ability to quickly respond to your team and your company's needs. As long as you can retrive information in a timely fashion, you are probably keeping organized well enough to meet your needs.
