<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Jadon Naas, and this is a personal blog I'm working on to help me learn Svelte, Sapper, and better interface design. I also will write about JavaScript and other technology related topics from time to time as a test of my own knowledge and as a way to help others for whom other existing tutorials on the Internet may not have clicked.</p>
