# Leadership Anti-patterns: Introduction
This individual series looks at leadership anti-patterns. An anti-pattern is a concept from software development, but more generally it is a way of solving a problem that seems like a common sense or acceptable solution that actually causes more problems or harm than a proper solution to the problem at hand. Leadership is a difficult job, and many leaders may not always have a good solution to the challenges or problems they face. In these situations, a good enough solution can seem like the right solution, but these good enough solutions often have unforeseen costs or problems that could have been easily avoided by taking a little more time to consider alternative solutions.

## Anti-patterns are about you - the leader
The anti-patterns in this series are all behaviors that a leader does. They are not about your team's performance or behavior, but these anti-patterns will certainly negatively impact your team's performance. Avoiding these anti-patterns can help make you a better a leader for yourself and for your team, but they are changes that you have to make on your own.

## These anti-patterns are habits
Each of these anti-patterns is a habit or an established set of behaviors. They are not single actions taken in response to single situations. They are the go-to response you as a leader may take in response to the regular challenges you face managing and leading your team. 

## The anti-patterns
The following list is by no means exhaustive. New anti-patterns may be added to the series as they are suggested. If you have a suggestion feel free to [submit an issue to the GitHub repository for this blog](https://github.com/jadonn/blog/issues).

### Losing your domain expertise
Domain expertise is the knowledge and skills your team uses to perform the main responsibilities and tasks for your team. Leaders can easily lose their ability to do the work their team members are expected to do, but this can make you a less effective leader overall.

### Thinking meetings are a waste of time
Meetings are the life blood of larger teams and organizations. Meetings are not a waste of time in their own right; many people just do not know how to have effective meetings. As a leader, the meeting can be one of your more effective tools for maintaining the flow of information to and from your team.

### Underestimating the value of relationships
You do not work for the company or with other departments. You work for and with other people. A good leader is a leader for the team, but a great leader is a leader for everyone.

### Not taking care of yourself
Taking care of your team starts with taking care of yourself. A leader who is stressed out, burned out, or overwhelmed cannot effectively respond to the team's needs.

### Doing too much line level work
A leader has to help the team from time to time with their main work and responsibilities; however, a leader also has to lead, and time spent doing line level work is not time spent leading the team.

### Not keeping organized
Like technical debt (another software development concept), organizationl debt accrues more quickly than you think and can easily eat up too much of your time and effort. Keeping yourself organized will cost less time than trying to deal with a disorganized work life.
