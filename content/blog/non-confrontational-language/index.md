# Non-confrontational Language

## What is Non-confrontational Language
Non-confrontational language is language that is designed to express specific ideas and feedback without causing a negative emotional response in the listener. Non-confrontational language includes but is not limited to tone, word choice, sentence structure, presentation, and body language.

## Confrontational Language
Before we look at non-confrontational language, let's take a look at some examples of confrontational language.

### Accusatory Words
Accusatory words are words that specifically accuses the listener of doing something or being responsible for some outcome. This language can be well-intentioned by the speaker, but it often can leave the listener feeling attacked or on the defensive. A listener on the defensive is not listening for what the speaker is saying; the listener is looking to escape the conversation or to make a defense.

#### Examples of Accusatory Language
1) You failed to meet your monthly goals.
2) This customer was unhappy with your help.
3) Your idea is not practical.
4) I'm not happy with your performance recently.

### Public Shaming
Public shaming is addressing someone's unsatisfactory behavior or performance in a public setting. A manager or leader may feel like publicly addressing an issue will "send a message" or "make an example" to other team members and serve as a deterrent towards others making that same mistake or problem. Public shaming does send a message, but maybe not the message the leader or manager intends. Publicly critizing or talking down to an employee tells the employee that you do not respect the employee and the employee's feelings. Other employees also learn they have to be afraid of going through this experience themselves. They do not listen to the lesson. They just think "Wow, I don't want this to happen to me. I can't believe this is happening." Public shaming most often leaves the targeted employee embarrased and ashamed in front peers, and other employees in fear of suffering the same treatment.

#### Examples of Public Shaming
1) Calling out a team member in front of the rest of the team.
2) Addressing an individual's performance in a group message or group email.
3) Publicly publishing performance evaluations.

#### Publicly Addressing an Immediate Issue
There are some rare occasions when an unacceptable behavior must be addressed immediately in public. In these instances, the behavior must be addressed, but it is important to use other non-confrontational strategies to handle the situation with as much care as possible. In these situations it is important to follow up with the responsible individual or individuals privately as soon as possible to further address the behavior and to make clear shame and embarassment was not the goal.

### Extreme Statements
Extreme statements are statements that exaggerate the facts or that use especially strong language. These kinds of statements often come from strong emotions. It is easy to jump to making these kinds of claims when you are upset or unhappy with the situation or with the individual with whom you are speaking. Such statements are harmful because they do not fit the facts, and they often leave the listener feeling hurt or attacked. It is never the case that someone always does a particular thing, and saying so makes the listener feel like the times when he or she did things properly do not count. The listener also often feels the need to defend his or her actions or record, which means the listener is not paying attention to your message.

#### Examples of Extreme Statements
1) You always do that thing.
2) I never see you do what I ask you to do.
3) This was the worst thing you could do.

## Types of Non-confrontational Language
There are several types of non-confrontational language and strategies for ensuring more effective communication, especially in sensitive or difficult situations. These strategies can be mixed and matched as needed to achieve your desired outcome -- communicating with others.

### Make Sure Goals are aligned (Same team)
One of the most effective strategies for managing a difficult emotional situation is helping the other person or people to understand you are all on the same team. You need to make sure you understand how you are on the same team in order to explain this clearly. Truly, you all should be on the same team of trying to reach a positive outcome from the situation and making a plan to avoid the situation from reoccurring in the future.

You will need to find out from the other person what that person's goals are. You can ask questions like "What do you think would help with this situation?" or "How can we do things differently in the future to prevent this from happening?" or "What can I do to make this better for you?". The important thing is to understand the other person's point of view and respect the other person's aims.

It may not always be possible to fully meet the other person's goals or desires, especially when considering those needs against business needs. However, people are often willing to compromise or be flexible if they feel their needs are going to be met within a reasonable period of time. Someone who feels underappreciated at work, for example, may be willing to accept recognition in the form of receiving new responsibilities in the future, even though that does not mean giving some kind of recognition now. Such an outcome can be further reinforced if there are opportunities in the immediate future to work towards the future goal. In the example of giving an underappreciated team member new responsibilities, you could start immediately with targeted coaching and training, as time allows, to prepare that team member for future responsibilities.

### Using I statements
"I statements" are statements that start with the word "I". They express your opinion or statement as a clear statement of your individual feelings or perceptions. "I statements" are great for expressing difficult ideas or information in a non-hostile way, especially when coupled with a respectful tone. "I statements" are often "Accusatory Words" that have been reworked to remove the accusation from the statement.

"I statements" are effective because they recognize and communicate to the other person that the statement is your individual perception, not an assertion of facts. Using "I statements" lets your listener know you are open to listening to new information and changing your opinion or perception based on that information. These statements also can remind you that your perception of a situation is simply your perception and not the actual indisputable facts of a situation.

#### Example I Statements
1) I feel the situation could have been handled better.
2) I believe you have been struggling recently with our work. Is that accurate?
3) I understand you are unhappy with your current position.
4) It seems to me like we have been having difficulties with meeting our goals.

### Focus on Facts
When in a difficult or uncomfortable situation, focusing on the bare facts of what happened or what is going on can provide a useful starting point for moving a conversation forward. Focusing on the facts can keep otherwise emotionally charged people concentrating on the problem at hand instead of attacking, defending, or blame-seeking behaviors. You should try to state your understanding of the situation in a non-personal way and ask clarifying questions to confirm your understanding and probing questions to further develop your understanding. It is very important, though, that your questions are impersonal and focused strictly on what happened, not why something happened or who is responsible for what happened. You should frequently restate your understanding of the situation to check your knowledge of the facts as you can continue to learn.

Facts are objective statements of what happened without any assumption of a cause, such as "The customer was unhappy.", "The order was late.", or "The target goal for the team was not met this month." Facts should be things that people can generally agree on without too much debate or discussion.

What is a fact may change depending on the person's perspective. You should try to compromise and reach agreement with the other person on what happened, but you should respect the other person's perspective if your facts do not agree.

#### Example Fact-finding Questions
1) What happened?
2) Can you tell me what you saw?
3) What is your take on the situation.
4) I understand this is how things happened. Do I have understand correctly?

### Solutions-oriented, Not Blame-oriented
Looking for someone to blame is a natural response to a difficult or emotionally charged situation. As a leader or facilitator, you should generally always avoid placing blame, even if a state of affairs was really someone's fault. Blame-seeking, however, does not help solve the problem at hand. Placing blame is not meant to solve any problems. Blaming someone just means the blamed person feels bad and is ashamed or embarrassed. Other people who see blaming done may feel fear of being similarly embarrassed in the future if they do something wrong. The blamed person likely does not feel valued and respected, and this person will be less likely to help or want to put the best effort into solving the problem.

When looking to place blame, focus instead on finding a solution to the problem or the situation at hand. Other people will usually not resist too strongly to focusing on developing a solution instead of finding someone to blame. Most people recognize that time spent blaming is not time spent resolving the issue that is happening right now and is a problem for the team.

It can be very helpful to make a note for yourself to review the chain of events leading up to a situation to determine how to avoid the situation in the future. You may also want to make time to talk to everyone one-on-one privately to discuss what happened further and to make sure everyone is satisfied with the outcome.

### Solicit Feedback
One of the easiest and most effective ways to make someone feel engaged and valued is to ask for feedback. Many of the other strategies discussed in this post use the listener's feedback to help build a sense of togetherness for solving the problem at hand or reaching a positive outcome in the current situation. When soliticing feedback, you should always let the other person speak entirely before responding. Many people have a natural response to interrupt the other person or to consider their next response before the speaker finishes speaking. You must fight this habit to be an effective listener for others.

Soliciting feedback does require some thought and care. Open-ended questions are generally much better for soliciting feedback instead of simple yes-or-no questions. Of course, you can still ask a yes-or-no question if you only need to confirm information on a specific point. However, open-ended questions are much better at inviting the other person to provide more detailed and in-depth responses than you would get from a simple yes or no.

Shaping your questions is a skill that can be practiced and improved. Some of the best open-ended questions do not presuppose any value judgment or answer from the other person. Consider how you would ask yourself for information about a specific topic or situation and look at how your response changes based on the question you ask.

#### Example Open-ended Questions
1) How did you feel when that happened?
2) What do you think about the recent staff meeting?
3) Have I stated your position correctly?
4) What can you tell me about the last time this happened?

### Privacy
In most cases, the privacy of others should be upheld as much as possible. Difficult or emotional conversations should always be held in private. People generally have a certain image of themselves they share publicly. Threats to that image, such as an embarrassing callout in front of other team members, can leave people feeling ashamed and unappreciated. People also often are more forthcoming with their true feelings when they have a safe, private environment in which to state them.

#### Example Private Conversations
1) Performance Evaluations
2) Disciplinary Actions
3) Gathering information on an potential or actual difficult situation
4) Discussing emotional situations post-resolution

### Respect Feelings
Throughout any conversation, difficult, emotional, or otherwise, you should always strive to respect the other person's feelings. This does not mean you have to do what other people want or try to make other people happy all the time. There are real restraints and limitations on what you can do to improve the outcome or situation for your team members or for other people; however, you can always let the other person know that you have heard their opinion and that you sympathize or empathize with them, whether or not there is some concrete action you can take in response to the feedback you receive.

### Express Gratitude
After every serious or important discussion, you should take time to express your genuine gratitude for the other participants' help and their willingness to share their feelings and information. When someone shares or volunteers information, that person is trying to help you, and you should be grateful for the help.
